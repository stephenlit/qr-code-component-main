## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced using CSS custom properties for color management, Flexbox for layout and centering, and a mobile-first workflow. I also learned how to use Google Fonts and organize CSS with normalization in a separate file.

Example of using CSS custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
  --slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

Example of centering content with Flexbox:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100svh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue improving my responsive design skills and explore more advanced CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid. I also plan to focus on accessibility and semantic HTML.
